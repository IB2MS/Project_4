# Description
## Overview
In this project, we examine the Sleep Efficiency Dataset in order to learn more about factors that contribute to sleep efficiency. 
### Dataset and Research Questions
This project was built using dataset [Sleep Efficiency Updated](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishhjain/sleep-efficiency-updated-dataset) sourced from Kaggle. 
This data set comprises 619 records with 15 columns listing participants' sleep data, including sleep efficiency and duration, as well as demographic (age, gender) and habitual information (caffeine intake, exercise frequency).

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
### Machine Learning Models
We created two machine learning models. Using the Tensor Flow model and the linear regression model, we are able to determine that the information in the columns has a strong impact on sleep efficiency.
