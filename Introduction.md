## Overview:

Project Draft Proposal : 
Primary Project Data set : Sleep Efficency 
                  Column : 15 columns
              Data count : 453 records
Objective: Train the model to identify sleep patterns based on factors like Alcohol, Caffine, Exercise, Smoking, Gender. 
Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (inefficient sleeper) and 1 (healthy sleeper) labels? Based on : Higher than 85% (.85) Sleep efficiency is healthy sleep and less than(.85)85% inefficiency sleep
* Visualizations on sleep patters by Age, Gender.
* Impact of sleep duration by lifestyle habits like Alcohol, Caffine, Exercise, Smoking
* We will use tools like : Pandas, Matplotlib, SQL, Tableau
1. Prepare the Data : Read the csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame. We will clean the data according to efficient sleep which is 85% or higher, for null columns we will add 0 to them.  
2. Create the labels set (y) from the columns, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
3. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.
4. Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
5. Use your knowledge of logistic regression to complete the following steps:
6. Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).
7. Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.
8. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance by doing the following:
9. Generate a confusion matrix/Logistic Regression Model.
10. Print the classification report.
11. Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 and 1 labels?
* Tableau : visualize our results on tablue dashboard for visual representation
* Pandas : visualize different columns
